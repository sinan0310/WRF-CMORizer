! PURPOSE / DESCRIPTION:
!   This application postprocesses (standard) raw WRF simulation results into
!   CORDEX (and CMIP5) compliant NetCDF files in a dedicated directory tree.
!   See the references below for the specifications used for this program.
!   The code can easily be adjusted in case specifications change. The post-
!   processing is necessary in order to being able to upload, stage and
!   distribute RCM simulation results via the Earth System Grid infrastructure
!   adopted by CORDEX from CMIP5. Files which do not adhere to this are
!   rejected.
!   Other, similar tool-sets are e.g.: (i) CMOR, (ii) XXXX wrf spain [...]
!   This tool has be seen in conjunction with 
!   (1) [...]

! CATEGORY:
!   PostPro.RCM.WRF.
!
! CALLING SEQUENCE:
!   ./postpro_model_WRF_to_ESGcompliancy > log
!
! CALLED FROM:
!   Standalone command-line tool.
!
! LOCAL VARIABLES:
!   See the variable declarations at the beginning of the code.
!
! INPUTS:
!   - NML files, see the tools main directory, have to be adjusted.
!   - WRF static fields (geo_em*)
!   - WRF outputs (wrfout*)
!   - WRF outputs extremes (wrfxtrm*)
!   No optional inputs, no keyword parameters.
!
! FILES USED:
!   - See inputs.
!
! OUTPUTS:
!   - NetCDF files according to standard specification.
!   - No Optional outputs.
!
! RESTRICTIONS:
!   - No restrictions. No side effects.
!
! BUGS:
!   - None.
!
! PROCEDURE / FEATURES:
!   - The tool can produce all required variables, i.e. output NetCDF files as
!     defined in the CORDEX archive design specifications as available in
!     July/August 2013 in possibly one pass based on standard WRF simulation
!     outputs. No additional processing is needed. Also the reuiqred NetCDF-4
!     classic data model format is written immediately, no later conversion
!     needed.
!   - 3hr data is produced first. This is closest to outputs most groups have
!     anyway. It is possible to produce more 3hr output than needed, i.e. for
!     all variables specified plus more vertical levels. Thereby the tool might
!     also be used for a general data volume reduction after a model run.
!   - The application loops over various averaging intervals, then over
!     variables and then over the existing WRF data files.
!   - Very large WRF outputs and/or even larger model domains than used in
!     CORDEX can be handled as the tool is working on individual output
!     intervals only. The tradeoff is a more I/O overhead but lower RAM
!     requirements.
!   - The FORTRAN code is ISO FORTRAN95-compliant except for the "SYSTEM" calls.
!     Hence the tool should be portable easily.
!   - The tool has minimum requirements in terms of libraries or external tools.
!   - FORTRAN was chosen for its fast execution speed, suitable for the
!     large datasets and the possibility to use the tool in HPC environments as
!     well as on individual workstations with a good performance. Also it is
!     easily possible to parallelize portions of the code via e.g. OpenMP.
!   - By splitting the *vars* namelist, the tool may be run concurrently for
!     different portions of a WRF output dataset.
!   - No code modifications are needed to run the tool and customize it for use
!     with a different WRF experiment. Only the NML files need to be changed.
!   - Different WRF input sources are possible, currently the tool is designed
!     for wrfout and wrfxtrm files.
!   - The tool creates a reference time vector. The time-information contained
!     in each original WRF sim. file is retrieved and according to this
!     information data is sorted into the resulting NetCDF files. This makes the
!     the tool rather robust and flexible, a tradeoff is the possibly longer
!     processing time due to the searches needed for the date and time matching.
!     However these searches are on subsets only and therefore fairly efficient.
!     It also means that the WRF outputs may cover any timespan, daily, monthly,
!     or any overlap of months and/or years and that they may come in filelists
!     even not temporally ordered.
!
! noCMOR
!   - Different ways of date/time handling:
!     (A)
!     With CORDEX archive protocol, at 3hr resolution, data is stored annually; 
!     daily data is stored 5-yearly. A file is automatically created if it does
!     not exist, based on the time information in the raw model output. Then 
!     data is sorted in.
!     (B)
!     If the tool is used for general postprocessing, then sometimes timespans 
!     of less than a year are simulated; for this case there is a flag noCMOR,
!     it leads to files being created according to a spcified timespan.
!     The overall length of the simulation time-span, i.e. the general offset
!     is independent of this.
!
!
!   - Currently only one input root directory is possible. If data is stored at
!     different locations symbolic links might have to be done beforehand.
!   - The static fields are treated independently by the tool.
!   - Currently the namelists are split into several parts but they may also 
!     be combined. 
!   - The tool is also intended to reduce WRF model output data volume. This
!     means that original raw model outputs are likely to be erased afterwards.
!     Therefore the tool generates slightly more variables than required by the
!     CORDEX data protocol: e.g. CAPE, ....
!
! EXAMPLE:

!
! MODIFICATION / REVISION HISTORY:
!   See either git log or NEWS for details.
!   2013-08-09_KGo v0.1
!
! TODO / PLANNED EXTENSIONS:      ------    outdated
!   - Temporal aggregations, i.e. 6hr, day, mon, seas; all based on orginal
!     outputs
!   - Static fields processing
!   - All variables -> extension of namelist
!   - Variable-dependent processings, e.g. MSLP
!   - time_bnds and lvl vars and processing, ask Grigori about this 00,24 thing
!   - Import of alternative (to NML) ASCII file with long and standard names
!   - Add units to that ASCII file as well
!   - Not yet tested with EUR-11, i.e. large model outputs
!   - Additional variable in runctrl.vars.nml to control additional 3hr outputs
!     to have all vars in that format and have more vertical levels
!   - (OpenMP parallelism for the processing section), via pre-processor flags
!   - (Parallel NetCDF I/O where possible), via pre-processor flags
!
