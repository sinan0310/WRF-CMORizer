# CURRENT CODE OWNER(S): 
#   Klaus GOERGEN (KGo), FZJ/IBG-3, k.goergen@fz-juelich.de
#
# VERSION (version control via git): 
#   2023-11-11 -- revision details are in the git log
#
# STATUS:
#   Release
#
# PURPOSE: 
#   - After CMORization checks integrity of highest temporal resolution (e.g., 
#     1hr) )output ito clarify whether (i) the CMORizer ran OK, (ii) there are 
#     no I/O issues, (iii) the filesystem has not caused any issues with the 
#     data.
#   - This shall help to avoid errors downstream during aggregation, QA 
#     checking, and usage of the data.
#
# USAGE: 
#   - sbatch ./$0 <root_dir(s)_of_CMORized_output>
#   - Adjust sbatch settings to your local HPC environment.
#
# EXAMPLE: 
#   - sbatch ./pCMORizer_check_integrity.sh /p/scratch/cjjsc39/goergen1/sim/tmp_FPSCONV/tmp_DA/postpro/CMORized/CORDEX-FPSCONV /p/scratch/cjjsc39/goergen1/sim/tmp_FPSCONV/tmp_DA/postpro/CMORized_2_was_thought_to_be_OK/CORDEX-FPSCONV
#
# EXAMPLE FOR TESTING: 
#   - ./$0 <root_dir(s)_of_CMORized_output>
#   - nohup ./$0 <root_dir(s)_of_CMORized_output> > output.txt &
#   - See manual adjustments in the code to run on front node for single 
#     variable (and year) tests.
#
# PROCEDURE: 
#   - Designed to  run on HPC compute node to allow for fast processing. Uses
#     ntasks in parallelr; loads all threads ("&") and then wait ("wait) until 
#     current batch (e.g., 128 processes) has finished. Total runtime is below
#     30 min to check 10 years of 1hr CMORized CORDEX-FPSCONV output with 128
#     core on JSC JURECA-DC HPC.
#   - By reading ifiles and calculating statistics (cdo info) the tool detects
#     (i) unreasonable data), (ii) fields with NaN values (missing values in the
#     data due to pressure level intersections with topography are not detected
#     as this is a feature, (iii) isses with the internal file structure (if a 
#     HDF5 based netCDF4-classic file has is internally flawed for whatever 
#     reason the tool issues a warning in the log. 
#   - Adjust the RegEx in the for loop according to your needs. Otherwise all 
#     netCDF files are checked.
#   - Manually check the standard output on the command line (test example) or
#     check the file with the scheduler output for results. Optionally check 
#     statistics for each timestep for each input file analysed.
#
# INPUTS / ADJUSTMENTS:
#   - Parm1: CMORized data path, top level directory. Multiple paths may be 
#            specified after each other. They must not lead to CMORized data
#            of the same experiment. Otherwise the same statistics files of
#            the two experiments overwrite each other in the dirLog/ output.
#            directory.
#   - sbatch settings: Adjust to your needs. The job-name is used to to name
#            the output log file and the directory with the individual 
#            statistics files.
#   - Adjust the compute environment settings to your needs.
#
# OUTPUTS:
#   - Output1: When started with sbatch (normal operation) main output is in
#              scheduler log file, naming is according to script name and slurm
#              job ID ID. Output contains of (i) all files worked on, including 
#              error messages if a bad file has been encountered, (ii) a listing 
#              which file has how many NaN fields, (iii) a detailed listing per 
#              file where NaNs occur (which timestep).
#   - Outout2: A newly created directory in tune run-directory with a naming 
#              according to script name and slurm job-ID (or date alternatively)
#              which contains per checked input file a ASCII statistics file
#              of the cdo info output.
#
# REQUIREMENTS: 
#   - bash shell
#   - CDO -- tested with CDO v2.1.1
# 
# RESTRICTION:
#   - Assumes slurm is used as scheduler if used on HPC.
